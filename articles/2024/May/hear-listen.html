<p>I don't remember the source of the media that I was consuming at the time; this was at least thirty years ago. What I do remember is that it was audio and visual, probably a television program. Maybe it was an episode of LA Law (yep, I'm that old), which had striking compassion for disability at the time. What struck me most was a sense of compassion for a person that could not hear or speak.</p>
<p>This person was stamping their foot on the floor, trying to get the attention of another person with a similar impairment, as that is the signal that would have reached them. Or maybe the other person was not impaired, which would have been even more frustrating - to the person without the ability to speak, it would have seemed that they were intentionally ignored.</p>
<p>To most of us, the vocalizations of this individual might have sounded off-putting. But their humanity was clear; they had something to communicate that was important to them, and nobody would listen.</p>
<p>Clearly, this awareness has stayed with me for decades, a powerful reminder of the essential need for empathy in communication. The physical action of stamping on the floor was a desperate attempt to bridge the gap caused by their inability to use conventional means of communication. Whether the intended recipient of their message shared their impairment or not, the act highlighted a profound struggle - the struggle to be heard and understood in a world that often overlooks those who cannot communicate in traditional ways.</p>
<p>Witnessing this scene evoked a deep sense of empathy within me. It underscored the importance of being attuned to the various ways in which people express themselves, especially when conventional communication methods fail. The frustration and desperation of the individual trying to get their message across were palpable, a stark reminder of the isolation that can accompany communication barriers. I cannot express my appreciation for writers that create such imagery, which almost certainly comes from personal experience.</p>
<p>This person's struggle was a poignant reminder that the essence of communication lies not in the method of exchange but in the message itself. This experience called for a shift in my perspective - to focus not on the mode of expression, but on the content and intent behind it, on true engagement across all senses, on presence.</p>
<p>I integrated an important and valuable lesson at that moment: instead of shooting the messenger or subverting the mechanism, absorb the message, regardless of the channel or its form of conveyance. If someone tries to get your attention, consider the content, not the technique. We are all trying to connect and communicate, though with social media and tools like slack that immediately relegate content that is important to the poster into the distant and forgotten past, it often feels like shouting into a vacuum that is somehow crowded with useless clutter.</p>
<p>This article is a call to action for all of us to be more mindful and compassionate listeners and to recognize and validate the efforts of those who may not communicate in conventional ways. It is a reminder that true understanding requires us to put our own personal context into the background, to look beyond the surface and to connect with the human experience at the core of every meaningful message. We are all struggling to be understood. Remember that technology is not always a solution and is always working to reduce our humanity. If you don't pay attention to everyone in your experience, regardless of their communication styles, you may be missing some important messages.</p>
<p>Those of us that have the capacity to understand have an obligation to make the effort to comprehend those that cannot always communicate effectively.</p>
<p>Thank you, my faithful readers. Where would I be without you?</p>
<p>Note: if you want to be heard, don't talk when I'm typing. My days of true multitasking are long past.</p>
<p>PS: I'm lazy; ChatGPT took my idea and wrote about half of this. And sorry, I couldn't quickly get ChatGPT to generate a decent image with the communicator looking at the back of the message recipient. These things take too much time, and again, I'm lazy. I liked the style of the first image but gave up after about five additional attempts.</p>
