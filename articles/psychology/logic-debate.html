            <h1>Logic</h1>
<p>It seems that most people have significant gaps in their logic. Avoid arguing with people who do not recognize superior logic.</p>
<p>This is not a logic primer. I highly recommend that all readers study formal, informal, and all other types of logic, as well as critical thinking. Consider starting with logic and following as many of the referenced topics as possible. Read books and take courses about logic, debate, and critical thinking, including media literacy and social media awareness.</p>
<p>Focus on the various types of logical fallacies currently most prevalent, including those described herein.</p>
<p>Beware that logic is not the solution to everything; it is just one tool to make, analyze, and evaluate arguments.</p>
<p>Because logic is important to debate, and debate skills are relevant to logic, this content mixes both topics.</p>
<h3>Arguments</h3>
<p>Premises, arguments, and conclusions</p>
<h3>First Principles</h3>
<p>As opposed to conclusions drawn by applying the rules of logic to other premises, first principles refer to suppositions and facts that we all humans share without argument, which we cannot deduce or infer from other propositions or assumptions. </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia: First Principles</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Deductive Reasoning</h3>
<p>An argument is deductively valid if its conclusion must be true given that its premises are also true.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia: Deductive Reasoning</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Inductive Reasoning</h3>
<p>Inductive reasoning refers to generalizations  and principles determined based on observations, in which conclusions are probable but not certain.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia: Inductive Reasoning</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Straw Man</h3>
<p>A straw man argument may be valid but attempts to counter a point other than made in the original argument without acknowledging the distinction.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia: Straw Man</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Ad Hominem</h3>
<p>Ad hominem refers to a diversionary tactic of attacking characteristics of the opponent rather than the substance of the substance of their argument (shooting the messenger).</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia: Straw Man</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Logical Fallacies</h3>
<p>There are numerous additional types of logical falacies.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia: Logical Fallacies</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_fallacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia: Formal Fallacies</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informal_fallacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia: Informal Fallacies</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Bad Faith Argument</h3>
<p>A bad faith argument occurs when a speaker projects one set of feelings or beliefs while speaking or acting under in a contradictory manner. This may be evidence that your opponent never intended to argue rationally with logic.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_faith" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia: Bad Faith</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deception" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia: Deception</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Whataboutism</h3>
<p>Whataboutism avoids responding to an argument by changing the subject to a related topic that may bear some similarity to a valid original point.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whataboutism" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia: Whataboutism</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Occam's Razor</h3>
<p>Occam's Razor suggests evaluating the simplest explanations constructed from the least number of premises and arguments rather than assuming more complex causes.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam's_razor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia: Occam's Razor</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_razor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia: Additional logical and philosophical razors</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Moving the Goalposts</h3>
<p>Moving the goalposts refers to changing the objective of an unresolved argument to give one party a relative advantage.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_the_goalposts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia: Moving the Goalposts</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Dunning-Kruger Effect</h3>
<p>The Dunning-Kruger effect occurs when people with limited competence in a particular domain overestimate their abilities or when competent individuals underestimate their knowledge and skills. </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia: Dunning-Kruger Effect</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Cognitive Bias</h3>
<p>Cognitive bias refers to a systematic pattern of irrationality in judgment. Interpretations of individual and limited perspectives result in unique subjective realities, often leading to perceptual distortions, inaccurate judgments, illogical interpretations, and irrationality.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia: Cognitive Bias</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Confirmation Bias</h3>
<p>Confirmation bias occurs when a person favors information that appears to confirm rather than question their existing belief or interprets  ambiguous data as supportive of their current perspective. </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia: Confirmation Bias</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Groupthink</h3>
<p>Groupthink refers to a collection of individuals reaching invalid and illogical conclusions by attempting to avoid conflict and reach consensus in order to maintain cohesion.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia: Groupthink</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Shifting the Buren of Proof</h3>
<p>Beware of people that attempt to shift the burden of proof. For example, someone might state a conspiracy theory without any evidence, and then expect others to counter it by proving them wrong.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_(philosophy)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_(philosophy)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Appeal to Authority or Argument from Authority</h3>
<p>Referencing an authority figure does not prove a point.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Emotional Arguments</h3>
<p>Emotional arguments can be very effective and difficult to counter, but they are not logical arguments. Pressing an argument against someone that is crying makes them appear to be a victim and you an oppreessor. If someone tries to make you feel guilty or ashamed, they are using an emotional argument. Try to remain calm, avoid getting defensive, acknowledge their feelings, and focus on the facts rather than their feelings.</p>
<h3>Appearances Are Important</h3>
<p>Especially when debating in front of an audience, appearances are important. Keeping your composure gives the impression of confidence that can be challenging to an opponent while making increasing your support from anyone paying attention to the discussion.</p>
<p>Don't let others overpower you. Stay calm and rational. Maintain equanimity and focus on their words and arguments, not any combatative nature that may appear.</p>
<h3>Pick Your Battles</h3>
<p>You do not need to win every argument. In fact, it can be too your advantage to let others win small battles, so that they think that they win sometimes, while you focus on bigger issues. As long as it would not force you into positions or actions that you want to avoid, you especially may choose to let others win when they employ emotional arguments. In such cases, you may even want to apologize for disagreeing or arguing. When competing with children and others of lesser intelligence, you often want them to learn, but also to build their confidence through occasional succes. The same holds for sports, games, and other forms of competition as well.</p>
<h3>Do Not Act Defensive</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The lady doth protest too much, methinks
--William Shakespeare as Queen Gertrude in Hamlet</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Overreacting when you appear to have lost a point can appear as evidence of dishonesty.</p>
<h3>Do Not Abandon What Works</h3>
<p>You do not always have to stick to logic or a predefined plan. If humor and insult are working to your advantage, continue to use them, but in an appropriate manner, always backed up by rationally.</p>
<p>Then again, do not overdo it and do not overcommit to any approach. Always be ready to change tactics. </p>

<h3>Avoiding Answering Questions</h3>
<p>While you may avoid questions as an argumentative tactic, you should never allow an opponent to avoid a question where their answer - or lack of answer - could give you an upper hand. Often, neglecting to answer a question indicates that the opponent recogizes the weakness of their own positionThey may try to ignore the question and move on to other points, sometimes in a flurry to generate distraction.</p>
<p>When someone does not answer a question, calmly return to that issue at an opportune time.</p>
<h3>Prepare, Walk Away, Keep Notes, and Take Recordings</h3>
<p>In the heat of an argument, it can be difficult to remember everything. Sometimes - especially when tensions might otherwise escalate without leading towards any resolution - it may be best to walk away and sort your thoughts rather than engaging. It may be useful to prepare for a conflict that you know may be approaching by writing down the most important points that you want to convey. You may want to do the same when you think of something during the argument or want to remember to counter a point made by the other party. </p>
