<h1>I Struggle with My Own Ego</h1>
<p>I hope that I'm not the only person who struggles with their own ego. I constantly question my own sense of self-importance, self-esteem, and self-worth. My parents would never say such things, but since I was a child, strangers have told me relatively consistent things about my good qualities. I have always been uncomfortable with compliments. Maybe I have secretly appreciated the flattery. </p>
<p>Originally published to:</p>

</ul>
<p>It may appear to others that I have been relatively successful in life, and some of that may be due to my innate characteristics and efforts, but I can see all of it as dumb luck and lack of alternative interests. I am aware that nothing I ever do is perfect and much of it is not even good enough for my own standards, let alone those of people with greater capabilities than I have.</p>
<p>For a time, I felt almost famous in my small technical community, where I actually had fans that would ask to take selfies with me and express strong respect and appreciation. That situation became so unhealthy for my ego that I gave it up, for example abandoning thousands of followers that I had amassed on twitter more than a decade ago. To be honest, I still meet random strangers that know who I was in those days, and it still gives me the same mixed sense of both pride and somehow embarrassment. While I try to be humble, I seem to transition from an inflated ego that is actually arrogant to a fragile ego excessively ashamed of my own flaws and shortcomings, most of which likely are not even apparent to others.</p>
<p>I claim to write for myself and my children, but then why do I publish, why am I embarrassed when I look back and find errors or misguided thoughts, why do I check for the traffic reports, and why do I care for interactions online? Why do I care whether other people like me, or even worse, my output? Why do I care what other people think at all? I claim that I want to help others, but do I really think that anyone can benefit from reading what I write? Why do I have to make an effort and remind myself not to care what others think? Is my attempt to retain humility just another falsehood? Do I actually consider myself to be better than other people, or worse? Do I actually believe in equality?</p>
<p>Sometimes I feel below everyone else and sometimes I have to work hard to avoid judging others. I want to be a good listener, though often I just want others to listen to me. I waver between a need for social validation and a desire to just be left alone. While I want to maintain appearances for others, I also don't want to be seen at all. After I realize that I have been overconfident, I can find myself working hard to maintain a false bravado to hide my own sense of impostor syndrome. I am aware that my sense of self is itself a falsehood, but I can also feel completely alone, disconnected, misunderstood, and even ignored by every other person in the world. I constantly try to better myself but experience setbacks and fear that the goal is infinite. I am not always conscious when my defense mechanisms manifest. </p>
<p>Maybe all of this is related to what I suspect is my own bipolar tendencies (previously known as manic-depressive), which may run in my family. One day or even one moment, I can be excessively energetic, full of confidence, even braggadocio, and the next I can be fatigued, self-critical, and deeply ashamed of myself.</p>
<p>I realize that this is just a ramble; that seems to be how I express myself most completely nowadays. To be clear, I would appreciate any comments about others' own related experiences, but this post is not in any sense a request for personal support. I see this conflict in myself as a challenge that I must face on my own. I do not see compliments and would actually prefer constructive criticism.</p>

<hr />
<p>After writing, I asked Google Gemini what famous literature my words brought to mind. I'm actually a fan of both Hesse and Sartre, which seemed the most relevent, so no surprises there:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Hermann Hesse's Siddhartha</strong>: The journey of seeking a complete self, navigating the tension between the spiritual (solitude) and the material (social life).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Jean-Paul Sartre's concept of Bad Faith</strong>: Living inauthentically by denying one's freedom or responsibility, often by adopting a role (like the &quot;successful person&quot; or the &quot;humble person&quot;).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I am definitely on such a journey and working to avoid acting in such bad faith.</p>
<p>I can often relate to a concept that I learned from Buddhism of walking the middle path between any extremes. It's like walking on a razor's edge sometimes, and confusing when I consider one side to be good and the other evil. Still, it does seem to be a good principle to keep in mind.</p>
<p>I guess I'm still trying to incorporate my shadow into my identity.</p>

<p>Maybe some of my thoughts on this topic come from the Hemispheres album by RUSH, or maybe these tendencies are related to why I like the band and particularly that album.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When our weary world was young<br />
The struggle of the ancients first began<br />
The gods of Love and Reason<br />
Sought alone to rule the fate of Man</p>
<p>They battled through the ages<br />
But still neither force would yield<br />
The people were divided,<br />
Every soul a battlefield...</p>
