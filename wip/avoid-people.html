            <h1>People to Avoid</h1>
<p>It seems that the number of possible negative personality traits severely outnumbers the number of possibly good personality traits. In truth, most people will have at least some characteristics to which you might object. To have any friends and especially to forge long-lasting intimate relationships, each individual must determine the points on which they are willing to compromise. Attempt to define the points on which you are willing to accept weakness before entering and especially committing to any relationship.</p>
<p>There are enough people in the world that you should be comfortable walking away from some without exploring all possibilities for interaction or working to restore relationships to which they have done the most significant damage. While it is possible for people to change, past behavior is the best predictor of future actions. Someone who disrespects or doesn't value your relationship today is unlikely to respect and appreciate you tomorrow.</p>
<p>Basically, avoid anyone that doesn't make you feel good, especially if they don't make you feel good about yourself. That doesn't mean that they must think you're perfect. If they want to help you, they should be able to present their suggestions as constructive criticism, not as complaints or ultimatums.</p>
<p>Your author strongly suggests avoiding people with avoidant attachment style. Relationships with avoidant people can be exciting and compelling, but also tend to be unhealthy, especially for people who themselves have anxious attachment styles.</p>
<p>In addition to developing the virtues listed previously and minimizing the converse traits in yourself, avoid people who engage in the behaviors described in this chapter and avoid such conduct in your own being.
In general, avoid people who have mental disorders, don't have logic, are not emotionally intelligent, don't feel good about themselves, or don't make you feel good about yourself.</p>
<p><em><strong>//TODO: Look for patterns, not one-off or occasional behaviors</strong></em></p>
<h3>Are Always Right</h3>
<p>Nobody is always right, regardless of how they act or what they claim. Someone who cannot accept that they too make errors lacks perspective, specifically the ability to introspect, and may not be capable of making changes required for growth and improvement.</p>
<p>Acknowledge when you are wrong, and beware of others that never see any fault in themselves.</p>
<h3>Never Apologize</h3>
<p>When it has been brought to their attention that someone has injured another, the first and most appropriate step towards reconciliation is an apology. Refusing to accept responsibility or apologize can indicate a character flaw or an attempt to maintain control. An apology costs nothing and can provide a resolution to an issue that could otherwise escalate.</p>
<p>When someone takes offense at something that you have done, have no hesitation to apologize, but do not get into the habit of apologizing excessively. Your name is not &quot;sorry&quot;. An apology is an indication that you recognize that you have done something wrong and intend to change your behavior to avoid recurrence. Someone who will not apologize does not recognize that they need to amend their ways.</p>
<h3>Are Critical or Judgmental</h3>
<p>It can be helpful to point out when things are not optimal and make specific suggestions for how others could improve themselves, their lives, and the circumstances of others. People that constantly find fault in themselves, the world, society, and others are an emotional drain on those around them. If one perceives that something could be better, then one should work constructively to improve that thing rather than simply criticizing constantly.</p>
<p>Beware that you are not overly critical or judgmental of yourself, others, circumstances, or anything else, but instead work towards making improvements everywhere.</p>
<h3>Are Overly Categorical or Exaggerate Excessively</h3>
<p>Putting things into categories allows mental models that allow us to simplify the world and convey a significant amount of information with minimal words. For example, saying that someone is a narcissist communicates a great deal about the person, whether or not they are a narcissist (it would be better to say that they express narcissistic traits). While it can sometimes be appropriate to make categorical statements or exaggerate in order to make a point, excessive use of these rhetorics can be a form of manipulation.</p>
<h3>Lack a True Sense of Humor</h3>
<p>A sense of humor is a sign of intelligence and metacognition that makes life more pleasant and bearable. Humor can help us maintain equanimity. People that cannot recognize various forms of comedy or don't understand when it is appropriate to laugh can be difficult companions. </p>
<p>Stay away from people that have overly dark senses of humor, especially those that find pleasure in the misfortune of others.</p>
<h3>Play with Semantics</h3>
<p>One way that manipulators apply their techniques is to argue over the meaning of their words. This is a frustrating waste of time that is best avoided. Communicate clearly and directly rather than avoiding direct explanations.</p>
<h3>Devalue Your Achievements</h3>
<p>People with low self-esteem may avoid recognizing the strengths and achievements of others and may even belittle their successes. Without overflowing praise, congratulate others on their accomplishments.</p>
<h3>Rely on Emotional Arguments</h3>
<p>When logic fails them, some individuals resort to emotional arguments, which are invalid appeals to empathy, sympathy, and compassion. Refute these with logic.</p>
<h3>Use Sex for Power</h3>
<p>In intimate relationships, sex can be a form of power. Obviously, the physically stronger party in a relationship can take advantage of the weaker party, but someone with greater control of their emotions (or worse, someone that lacks true emotions) can use the other party's desire for intimacy, affection, and sex, such as by offering and withholding sex.</p>
<p>Obviously, everyone has the right to control their body and what happens to it. If there is a mismatch in your levels of desire for physical intimacy, or your partner is inconsistent with their affection, find a new partner rather than staying in a relationship that cannot fulfill your needs.</p>
<h3>Act Superior</h3>
<h3>Make Condescending Remarks</h3>
<h3>Give Dirty Looks</h3>
<p>Facial expressions can be remarkably effective in triggering emotional responses, especially in people who suffered various forms of abuse as children. Often, malevolent looks foreshadow inappropriate language or behavior, such as yelling or even physical abuse. If someone intentionally uses their facial expressions to stir up negative feelings, confront them about this habit, or abandon the relationship.</p>
<h3>Make Jokes that Aren't Funny</h3>
<p>Beware of people who make cruel jokes, use offensive sarcasm, or claim humor for something they said that was actually manipulative.</p>
<h3>Imply that You Are Mentally Deficient</h3>
<p>Avoid people that suggest that you are forgetful, insane, unintelligent, or otherwise mentally deficient.</p>
<h3>Bully You or Others (Physically, Intellectually, or Emotionally)</h3>
<h3>Are Disrespectful to Waitstaff and Other Service Staff</h3>
<h3>Use Physical Intimidation</h3>
<p>Including throwing things, breaking things, pounding on things, and making loud and startling noises.</p>
<h3>Raise Their Voice</h3>
<h3>Play (Too) Hard to Get</h3>
<p>People need to be guarded in order both to save and to demonstrate their worth. People that play too hard to get aren't worth the effort; move on.</p>
<h3>Guilt or Shame Trip</h3>
<h3>Make Invalid Ultimatums</h3>
<h3>Define Time Limits</h3>
<h3>Ask Loaded Questions</h3>
<h3>Are Pushy</h3>
<p>People who are always asking you for things and to do things with them or for them. People who try to get you to do things that they know that you do not want to do. People whose time is worth nothing will waste all of your time quite happily. Such busybodies are simply annoying to be around.</p>
<h3>Do Not Listen</h3>
<p>People who interrupt you. People who complete your sentences to quickly and too frequently. People who talk over you. People who don't seem to hear or understand what you say.</p>
<h3>Never Stop Talking</h3>
<p>Many people who have nothing to say never stop talking.</p>
<p>Basically, nobody wants to listen to them, so when they get a chance to speak, they can seem unstoppable.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Create Create No-Win Situations and Impossible Choices</h3>
<p>They are the only ones that can win. Even if it appears that they lose, they achieve some sense of power in their own minds, and possibly in yours. If there is no potential advantage to you, and only disadvantages, get out of the situation.</p>
<h3>Provide an Illusion of Choice</h3>
<p>One tactic used by manipulators is to give you an illusion of choice. For example, your friend or partner may ask what you want to do for entertainment or to where you would like to travel. When you respond, they may consistently disregard your opinion and pursue their original interests, whether or not they had stated them in advance. They want you to feel that your preferences matter them, but they want you to be happy with whatever they prefer.</p>
<p>Decisions that involve multiple parties depend on compromise. Maintain willingness to conceded, especially in unimportant matters, but don't be the party that always compromises.</p>
<h3>Catastrophize and Magnify Their Problems</h3>
<h3>Call You or Others Hurtful Names</h3>
<h3>Hypocrites</h3>
<p>Hypocrites are inconsistent in how they apply rules to others as opposed to themselves. In general, their rules and judgements are for you and not for them. They may tell you to do one thing while they do something else or judge you for doing something that they do. </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypocrisy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypocrisy</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Are Hypersexual, Sex Addicted, Love or Sex Bomb</h3>
<p>If hypersexuality or sex addiction is consistent, it's unhealthy. If it's inconsistent, it isn't real, and is likely manipulative.</p>
<h3>Feign Ignorance</h3>
<p>In order to manipulate others, such as to coerce various forms of assistance due to sympathy, some people pretend to be unintentionally ignorant, whether uninformed or lacking cognitive skills.</p>
<h3>Belittle Your Opinion</h3>
<h3>Are Unappreciative</h3>
<h3>Use Sleep Denial</h3>
<p>Especially in intimate relationships, sleep denial is a form of abuse. You do not want to be in a relationship with someone that would prefer to argue all night rather than shelving the issue for a future peaceful discussion.</p>
<h3>Create False Hope</h3>
<h3>Toy with Emptions</h3>
<h3>Demean Sarcastically</h3>
<h3>Deny Their Issues or Actions</h3>
<h3>Are Passive Aggressive</h3>
<p>Passive aggression describes hostile behavioral tactics wherein an individual avoids direct confrontation or even communication, such as showing up late or staying silent when a response would be appropriate. </p>
<p>When someone uses passive aggression, don't react. Don't apologize, don't get frustrated, anxios, or upset. Don't confront them. Don't trivialize but do minimize their behavior. Simply ask them what's wrong. Their response should dictate your next action, which may be to delay further interactions. If they don't want to address the issue over time, you may need to walk away.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h3>Use Other People</h3>
<p>Do not participate in superficial and exploitative relationships. Avoid one-way relationships, where you do things for someone but they do little for you. Some people attempt to play themselves as victims to establish pity and guilt in you, especially if they can manipulate circumstances or perspectives to make it appear that you contributed to their misfortune. They then use your empathy to control you.</p>
<h3>Are Overly Dramatic or Constantly Seek Attention</h3>
<h3>Use Coercive Tactics</h3>
<h3>Use Manipulative Tactics</h3>
<h3>Are Overly or Not Constructively Critical</h3>
<h3>Drain Your Energy</h3>
<h3>Are Constantly Negative</h3>
<h3>Always Have to Get the Last Word</h3>
<p>Beware of people who always want to get the last word, whether in friendly communications or in an argument. That doesn't mean that you should always get the last word but consider this tactic. In an argument, if both parties always want to get the last word, the argument will never end. It is not necessary to respond to everything.</p>
<h3>Are Controlling</h3>
<h3>Play the Victim Card, Seek Pity, or Act Like Martyrs</h3>
<p>Especially when they hurt you and then play the victim.</p>
<h3>Are Not Open and Communicative</h3>
<h3>Are Self-Centered</h3>
<h3>Disregard Boundaries</h3>
<h3>Are Not Attentive</h3>
<h3>Are Not Conscientious</h3>
<h3>Are Not Trusting</h3>
<h3>Are Not Accepting</h3>
<h3>Make Little Effort</h3>
<h3>Have Unrealistic Expectations</h3>
<h3>Cannot Compromise</h3>
<h3>Gaslight</h3>
<h3>Breadcrumb</h3>
<h3>Benchwarm</h3>
<h3>Monkey Branch</h3>
<h3>Do Not Take Responsibility or Show Accountability</h3>
<h3>Are Inconsistent</h3>
<p>Especially when their words are inconsistent with their actions.</p>
<h3>Are Perfectionists</h3>
<h3>Keep Secrets that Shouldn't Be Kept</h3>
<h3>Throw Others Under the Bus</h3>
<h3>Gossip</h3>
<p>If they gossip about others, they almost certainly gossip about you. Gossip is often a form of dishonesty; if a person has an issue with another, they should address that person directly.</p>
<h3>Stonewall</h3>
<h3>Stalk You or Others</h3>
<h3>Appear Able to Turn Off Their Emotions</h3>
<h3>Give the Silent Treatment</h3>
<p>When someone gives you the silent treatment, simply walk away, regardless of what you have invested in the relationship. Do not indicate that you will make any effort to resume communications.</p>
<h3>Are Judgmental</h3>
<h3>Frequently Overexaggerate</h3>
<h3>Are Isolated</h3>
<h3>Attempt to Isolate You</h3>
<h3>Don't Have Many Long-Term Friends</h3>
<h3>Triangulate</h3>
<h3>Share Secrets</h3>
<p>Don't share secrets early in a relationship. Never share secrets with people who share others' secrets with you. They will almost certainly share your secrets with others.</p>
<h3>Are Not Supportive, Are MIA, and Fair-Weather Friends</h3>
<p>Some people only appear when they need something from you.</p>
<h3>Backstab</h3>
<h3>Break Promises</h3>
<p>Especially those that break promises repeatedly.</p>
<h3>Play Games</h3>
<h3>Don't Care about the Feelings of Others</h3>
<p>People can pretend to care about you and others for quite some time before it becomes apparent that they only care about themselves. Look out for subtle signs. If something feels off in your relationship with another, even if you can't quite place the root cause, get away from that person.</p>
<h3>Have a Scarcity Mindset</h3>
<h3>Give You the Cold Shoulder</h3>
<h3>Are Evasive</h3>
<h3>Don't Know What Love Is</h3>
<h3>Don't Answer Questions</h3>
<p>Think about why a person doesn't answer a question. Are they not listening to you? Have they forgotten your question? Do they think it's not important? Do they have a reason to keep the answer secret? Are they playing a game with you? Are they intentionally disrespecting you? Are they avoiding the question? Are they overly modest? Unless someone can explain why they won't answer a question, there likely isn't a good reason. </p>
<p>At the same time, you don't have to answer every question asked of you. It's your choice whether to indicate why you won't answer a question. Maybe it's a topic you would prefer to avoid. Maybe they're crossing a boundary of yours. You can be honest about these things instead of being evasive.</p>
<h3>Aren't Willing to Try New Things</h3>
<h3>Are Grandiose</h3>
<p>Are attached to fantastical versions of themselves.</p>
<h3>Have an Excessive Need for Admiration</h3>
<h3>Act Entitled</h3>
<h3>Lack Empathy</h3>
<h3>Are Suicidal</h3>
<h3>Give You the Yoyo Treatment</h3>
<h3>Withhold Affection or Sex</h3>
<h3>Act Defensive</h3>
