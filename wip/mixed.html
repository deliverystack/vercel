<p>Even though I studied child development and psychology for two years of college, I know that I was never meant to be a great parent, partly because my parents were terrible parenting role models and I just don't have the patience and personality for it. That does not in any way mean that I don't love you, and I really tried for as long as I could. I am OK with the role of provider, but modern western expectations that fathers act like mothers really don't suit me.</p>

<p>The next moving picture is of my dad hitting me, pretty hard, in the face. I don't even know what I said. Clearly I am going to have to pull myself together to get us through this. He needs all the support we can give him.</p>

<p>A few nannies. Lauraine and her son Blake, a few years older than Tim, living in the mother-in-law unit. Kim, who took us camping with her husband.

That thing is a dangerous menace, especially at a kindergarten.</p>
<p>Anne never stops talking. It's like a form of punishment. We're so bored that I remember eating ants of a tree. Not a good idea, but better than listening. Now I don't remember a word that she said. Maybe it sunk in.</p>
<p>Toby, that poor kid with the thick glasses, biting me when I tried to befriend him. Toby, being made to stand on a stool, again, naked or with his pants down? I'm not sure, but humiliated in front of the class of 26 children. Taking an RV trip with Toby and his grandparents.</p>
<p>Mom's mom gave us bicycles. In the 70s, kids of any age could just ride around the neighborhood without any supervision. The big tree swing at Stephen's house. The big dog (Spot) at Andy's house. These are my other brothers. I barely remember living at Andy's house for months after the accident.</p>
<p>Not much clarity for the next few years. My dad dates Tracy. She has a dog that is half wolf. We end up with one of the pups. I don't remember our first dog Beagle, but apparently he's gone already. By this time we also have Duncan, almost a collie.</p>
<p>Tracy gives me Playmobile for my birthday. Of course I wanted Lego; how could she not know this. I will never forgive her; she will never be my mother. She shows up distraught one night. My father is with someone else now.</p>
<p>I don't remember the wedding. I remember the reception. We're at a big wooden table on the back deck at the new house. Oh my god this house is amazing. We have a pool. I'm eight and a half now. I'm drunk for the first time. Champagne.</p>
<p>We're supposed to call her Mommy-Judy, to help us transition. Now I have a step-sister. I remember us all naked in the shower together, but that's not physically possible. Judy's breasts are shriveled. Weird? Normal? How would I know?</p>
<p>In the station wagon, we get sideswipped. Adrian ends up with a piece of mirror in his forehead, and still has the scar. </p>
<p>Lots of bike riding. I treat my Schwinn like a BMX. Uncountable good things in my childhood. At Great Oak, we read The Five Sons of King Pandu, a somewhat-westernized introduction to The Mahabharata. The relationship between Krishna and Arjuna, and my respect for each of them, the of the brotherhood in the family, the protection of the honor of the woman, all seem to have a profound effect on me somehow.</p>
<p>But my parents are both drunks. Along with exercising and working, dad mostly drinks and watches TV. Judy is always cleaning.</p>
<p>Judy wants to adopt us. There is paperwork in process. We have our first physical confrontation. The dog eats the chickens that I got from school, Scott Joplin (my dad played piano) and Kirsten (named after a much older step-sister that didn't live with us). Ulysses (older step-brother that didn't live with us) giving us pocket knives. Somehow I have Ulysses' old purple bike, more like a real BMX.</p>
<p>Judy is dunk. She shoots the quarter-wolf dog, which has killed the neighbors sheep or chickens or something.</p>
<p>My dad starts recording audio of Judy's ravings to play back to her when she sobers up. She totals the Pinto and does significant damage to the beautiful ancient burgondy Mercedes.</p>
<p>We still have Duncan. I love that dog. He nipped me as a pup, but I think it was just playful, and I even think he tried to apologize. We end up with another dog, Max, close to a black lab but...wily. He needs to be chained up all the time.</p>
<p>My brothers and I have a lot of chores - sweep the decks, weed the flower beds, manage the garden, chop kindling, haul firewood. Sierra is generally responsible for &quot;watching the phone&quot;, on the weekends that she is not at her father's house. She has an indoor cat that is not allowed indoors, I think named Whitey. It doesn't last long in this farmlike environment. We never find the body.</p>
<p>Can it all be coincidence, or is something pushing me towards SE Asia?</p>
<p>I was born in 1973, the year that the US stopped bombing Laos and Cambodia, the year that Nixon agreed to end the Vietnam war, and the year that the US ended conscription.</p>
<p>I was born on 30 April, the day that Hitler shot himself, which ended &quot;the war to end all wars&quot;, and the anteversary of the day that the Vietnam war ended.</p>
<p>From the moment that I landed in Singapore, I knew that I wanted to live there for some time.</p>
<p>The only travel souvenir that I really care to keep is that hand-made note from the little girl in Cambodia.</p>
<p>In Vientiane, I ran into the family that I had met in Luang Prabang with the two Singaporean girls, reminding me that I have not lived up to my expectations of myself to do something for girls in this region.</p>
<p>For decades I have had an interest in both communism and Buddhism, which somehow coexist here (though, to be honest, both seem pretty weak).</p>
<p>Is it a coincidence that everyone who I meet that seems happy is doing something for charity?</p>
<p>Trying to start at the beginning. Hazy memories, still images. It's dark. I think my mother is putting on stockings. This may be the night of the party.</p>
<p>There are a few others, but the order is unclear. Glimpses of a happy birthday party for me with a Native American theme. Thanks Mom. Getting dropped off at daycare in my favorite shirt, but is that a real memory, or based on something I saw in a photograph? A blinking red light out the bathroom window, which could not really have been there, but I thought was Rudolph. I also saw the easter bunny while apparently sleeping in my parent's bed. A few scraps of dreams. These can't be real memories.</p>
<p>In the first moving clip with audio, it's my dad, sitting us down to tell us about the accident. She's not dead yet, but she's probably not coming back. Later I learned that she died in the helicopter on her way to donate her eyes. I'm four and a half years old. My younger brother laughs because he cannot understand. Neither of my brothers understands. I don't understand, but I know it's serious.</p>
<p>Releasing the helium balloons with our notes to her, when I couldn't even write and really didn't understand. Yeah, that really got me over it. Childhood is over.</p>
<p>The next moving picture is of my dad hitting me, pretty hard, in the face. I don't even know what I said. Clearly I am going to have to pull myself together to get us through this. He needs all the support we can give him.</p>

<p>Hello, this is John West. It's May 8, 2025 and I'm going to try and tell my story. It's long and complex so I maybe go. I started studying developmental psychology sometime in theins and with a specific focus on pathology, which means basically weaknesses in the human mind that can be exploited by external factors, but are often exploited naturally by stresses in their environment. And I'm also a technologist, so I started working with computers when I was about 11. And I've been working with computers pretty much most of the time ever since. So in about 2004, I joined a content management software company called Sicor. and about that was probably about the time that Facebook came out, and at that time, I had two issues with Facebook. One was that I was concerned about the whole concept of social media and what that would do with human psychology, and then also they were a competitor because people could suddenly put pages on Facebook and that would hurt the content management vendors. I'd also say that this whole time I follow technical media, so multidisciplinary media, you know, it doesn't really matter. I talked to listen to and when I say talk, I'm usually meaning people online and I really don't trust people online. I I everything I take with a great degree of skepticism and look for multiple sources and apply critical things and logical. I I do actually think I'm not just a conspiracy theorist listening to random people on the Internet. So um so Facebook started getting popular around 2005, 2007, somewhere in that time frame, that's when people really started using it. At around the same time, site Corps started exploring what we were calling at the time digital experience marketing. So collecting data about the target customers and um the people that were up browsing the website. I know I used terms that other people don't relate to. I'm sorry about that. It's just my industry. um so we created this product called the psychore digital experience platform, which was a precursor to the whole digital experience management industry, which is really mostly focused on targeting content and analyzing behavior and influencing people to purchase products and services from vendors or trying to lead them towards the content that's most appropriate for them based on their preferences. The thing is that this technology can be used in different ways to kind of manipulate people into other things. And a great example of that is Cambridge Analytica and how it's been used to influence elections. If you read the recent book by the woman from Facebook, I don't remember her name, but she it's being suppressed. It talks about her story at Facebook and I haven't I feel it's really long winded. I got through the first couple of of sections and it was just boring. So I haven't actually read that or listened to the whole thing, but there's I mean, it's not really it's pretty well documented that social media is used to influence elections. And this so I'm not going to go into all that. So around 2016, I sold my last shares of Cy Corps and retired, but then I went to Asia and I've um been working in Asia and traveling with in Asia and coming back and forth to allow for since then, basically. And so fast forward to like, I don't even remember when I did this, but at some point, I started I realized that I had been on this linkedIn site, which was typ was supposed to be a business network since, you know, so for business connections, looking for a job, things like that. And um I had been on this network. I think I got started in 2005 or something like that. So I't and I wasn't very active there. I used it for marketing for like push marketing. I would push out blog posts and and stuff like that. But I did develop a pretty significant network there. I don't I don't I think about 5,000 people that were like mostly recruiters probably, but a lot of technologists and customers things pretty much a lot of people. And I know I look like a lunatic on LinkedIn now that's kind of intentional and kind of an accident. we'll get into the details of that later. So I I was spending a lot of time in the USA and I don't have very many friends there and they're all busy all the time. And so I don't have a job and I was getting bored and I noticed that LinkedIn was starting to deteriorate. It was becoming more like Facebook and less like a business network. And so I changed my title there to chief LinkedIn Troll and decided that I was going to start not really trolling people, but more just like becoming a joker on on LinkedIn. And then this kind of changed my experience on LinkedIn my whole perspective on it. So instead of trying to market myself or my company, I was there trying to just figure out how the system worked or play the system, play the algorithm, whatever you want to call it. And over time, I grew into this, what I think is called a pod, but pod often means like a pod of bots, like a bunch of Russian hackers or something working together to subvert a system. So the, but LinkedIn does create these pods of people that are in the CMS industry or people that are in the BDBE commerce industry or whatever, it creates these little collections of people, and my pod started to become a collection of jokers and jokers are often people that are writers as well. So I developed this little pod and I started kind of analyzing how things on LinkedIn worked. and I was not aware of the risk. I absolutely entered this this story, this situation that I'm in by accident. I didn't know I wasn't trying to analyze anything. I was I was just kind of goofing off online. And um so then, you know, Linked continued to deteriorate and I I wasn't sure if it was because of my network, the people that I was connecting with or if it was the algorithm for kind of pushing bad content on me. Other people continued to tell me that they still had good experiences on Linked and I think it is possible to have good experiences on Link Maybe it is. Everybody this is the problem with everybody getting a different experience, a personalized experience is that there's no shared meaning. There's no shared understanding of the world anymore. And so LinkedIn personalizes the experience and we all get a different experience. And these technologies I know very well can be manipulated to devey different information to different people. So just as an example, let's say that LinkedIn has been hacked or whatever, your profile, when it presents to somebody else, could show them a different email address for you. So you you have a profile and LinkedIn, but when they click it, they don't get the email address that you put into the system. They get somebody else's email address. So that's a really example, a really good example of how this system can be hacked. if it's possible to do that, then almost anything is possible. You can I don't want to get into the details. There's there's so many vulnerabilities there. So I was in this pod, the Trump election happened, and immediately LinkedI just became this kind of political thing. At some point, I received a prompt from LinkedIn that asked me if I wanted political content or not. And I said, of course, I'd love to troll MGA. and I started trolling MAGA primarily and I was pretty cruel at first, but I'm over time I started being more political, like, oh, what MAGA points do what parts of the agenda do you support? Or what you learned about being a troll is you kind of play both sides. So especially in political trolling, you if if there's a right wing notag out there, you you go far left, and then you see how they respond to that. And if they you can respond if they get upset, then you can say, but, brother, I'm on your side. I'm a conservative too. You can you can kind of mess with them. And this disorients people and and messes with their psychology and it makes it hard for them to think and stuff like that. So you can kind of play that game. I wasn't really into that game. I was really just trying to make points of like anybody supporting MAGA doesn't really have a logical argument and they're kind of full of hate. So I got the political thing and over a time, I started following Al Jazeera and doing just I would connect with anybody and I wouldn't really check their profile too closely. I wasn't trying to identify hackers. I was just trying to goof and I was really trying to get banned and I was trying to reduce my followers and I kept threat so you hear about other people getting banned and shadow banned and stuff like that. And so I was constantly tagging LinkedIn itself saying, hey, why am I not getting banned? Is it this class action lawsuit? I keep threatening you with? because it's a business network. And if they're throttling or promoting some content based on how much you pay and people are disadvantaged and you could have a class action lawsuit based on that, I honestly think that. So, um, I'm trying to try and shorten the story a little bit, but I was conscious that something was wrong. Actually, a lot of people were complaining about the algorithm and being suppressed and stuff like that. And this seemed to be getting worse. It seemed like the algorithm was getting worse, which is really weird, that the algorithms should be getting better. It shouldn't be getting worse. At the same time, I was aware that, you know, the dodge and stuff were siphoning data out of the government. And I I follow a lot of issues. I have a lot of free time and a lot of interest in a lot of issues. So trying to put a lot of things together logically and analyze what is going on? Why how the hell did Trump get elected? And what's going on with this social media site called LinkedIn? It was really becoming a social media site. It was really just like Facebook. There's all sorts of jokes about how LinkedIn has become Facebook. Okay, so then okay. I'm going to jump. I might have missed some stuff, but I'll jump to a conversation that I was having with a random stranger on the Internet, you know, so not necessarily a trusted source, but was presenting quite aeared to be good information. We were I was argu not arguing. I was I had made a point about the risks of submarine drone swarms on aircraft carriers. And this person was responding, and it sound at first I thought they were navy, but then they indicated that they worked oil or oil platforms. And they seemed to know what they were talking about. I mean, they have some details that I don't trust any source necessarily, but I I believe that the information that they provided was accurate. So then I'm in Laos and I meet somebody that works for a company that nobody knows exists doing a job that nobody knows exists. So he's he's kind of um um he cleans up after operations that fail. So like the military has a little skirmish or whatever, something they're not supposed to be doing and they need to clean up the evidence or b get the bodies out or whatever it is. and he flies in and uh does that. And that's he doesn't work for the government. He works for some kind of contractor. I don't know what it I don't know the structure. and I'm not really sure what he said, or because at some point something just clicked in my head like, oh my God, I think I'm in danger because I've been doing this thing online and, uh, at the same time, we've got Trump, like the administration saying people that have social media histories that demonstrate anti-Trump comments are going to be deported out of immigration and things like that. So I suddenly put some risks together and said, the government at this point, I think it's the US government is doing stuff that it shouldn't be doing. And because I'm anti-government, they might be doing these things to me, like rendition or something like that. So I suddenly became worried, and this I literally, that so then I'm still talking to the oil fields guy and I say, hey, I met this guy that does this and and that guy responded that the oil guy said, oh, you've got some illegal information. This has happened to me before. You you, um you need to do certain things to protect yourself, whatever. I didn't do those things. I I don't know what I'm doing. I didn't do this on purpose. I stepped into this by accident. So one of the things he said is that you're probably on some he didn't say probably, he said, you're on somebody's kill list. And I know that two Americans that sounds crazy. If if you tell somebody you're on a kill list, they'll say you're crazy, there's no such thing, whatever. If you tell somebody in Southeast Asia that, and even expats that have lived here for a while, there are a lot of people hiding out here, that are like, which one, you know, or how do you know, or they they take it seriously. And if you tell somebody at a like allow hotel that you're on a hit list, they're like, you know, they don't really want you at their hotel or they and there's no support for you at all. So I have nowhere to go with this information, this this concern that that I I may be on a kill list. So the fact that I know that this company exists, this organization, whatever it is, makes that's illegal information and that that in itself puts me on a kill list. The fact that I have illegal information puts me on a kill list, potentially. I'm not a paranoid. I'm not a conspiracy theorist. I'm trying to assemble all these facts and and come up with a logical rational explanation for what is going on. So then I um, so weird things are happening on LinkedIn. Like the the more I troll, the more weird things happen and the more kind of I started calling them glitches in the matrix because no website in 2025 is this bad, um like just outages and just like you post something and it appears three times. So what what I assume from this is that they're changing something. They're changing the algorithm. They're changing the data. The servers are coming up and down. They're intentionally throttling me, which means like we don't want this guy posting anymore so we're gonna block his access temporarily, but if we do that too long, he's already threatened us with a class action lawsuit. So let's be careful. So the system's clearly being manipulated in some way that I don't understand. And so my brothers know that I previously had basically a psychological breakdown in a similar situation where on stackoverflow, I started analyzing how that system works. And I apparently, when I find technology being used to manipulate the human mind, to exploit its weaknesses, to achieve gains for an organization, that really bothers me. I don't really know why, but it comes probably from the developmental psychology of when a child is abused, what is does it do to their brain? And if technology is being used to ab abuse adults, what does that do to their brain? And I had also gone through complex post- traumatic stress disorder and done some research on that. My honest perspective is that the entire planet is suffering from various mild forms of complex, post-traumatic stress disorder from the chaos and uncertainty and the just the environ the I don't mean the environment like physically, but the whole psychological environment of the planet of this dread about global warming and right versus left and, you know, kind of constant hate. And a lot of that is driven by social media. And I I don't have I'm writing a book on that. I don't have time to get into the details of it. So I'm actually I'm literally at this point, I'm scared for my life and I I have nowhere to go for support, especially in Laos. And the um so one of the things that the guy that worked Oil feeds said was, you've got to keep your information secret because anything that can be written can be erased. So if you publish it, it can be deleted. And it's true. Like any system, look at what is happening with, you know, Dodge trying to shut down the Internet archive or those kind of things. They're trying not there. It is possible to suppress pretty much any information. It's hard to do it completely, but things don't have to be done completely. If you look at, you know, how manipulated MAGA is, there there's facts don't really matter to some people anymore. It's more like the narrative is what matters. So then I'm starting to get concerned about how I'm going to get what is my next step? I've got a 30-day visa for Lau and if I turn my passport into, iso going to give my passport to the US? Are they going to you know, are they going to rendition me because I've got this information, because everything you're doing is being tracked. And I've accidentally exposed myself online because I didn't know what I was doing. So I am afraid to cross a border because if I go to passport control, they'll they could identify it through passport, facial recognition technology, whatever. This guy is associated with anti-Trump and therefore we're going to collect him, or whatever you want to call it. I know that sounds paranoid, but these things are happening and Americans don't seem to be paying attention. and so meeting this guy that does the flying, I'm I'm like, okay, this is worse than I thought, but they'll they will actually come and get people in foreign nations and take them out. it's come out and get American citizens in foreign nations if they're a threat to the Trump administration. So, um again, LinkedI is getting more and more glitchy and more and more people are reporting it and um okay, so one second, I'm gonna pause and then So I'm I'm I this maybe I did get a little paranoid here. Um, I do believe that I have various mental health disorders. I believe I have complex post- traumatic stress disorder from, um childhood trauma and extended trauma in my uh marriages and relationships. I I have bipolar in my family and I have ADHD or some level of ADHD. Sometimes it's an advantage, sometimes it's a a drawback. And if I start to get stressed and have trouble sleeping, I have like like a manic episode where I feel like I'm really productive, I can't sleep, I'm hot, I'm sweating all the time. I know that I have these issues. I'm not it doesn't mean that I'm not rational. It means when I get really stressed out, I go into some kind of, I don't know. You know, there's fight or flight mode. There's actually four fight flights fawn or I can't remember from the CTPSD research, but I apparently go into like a fight mode of I'm and then I'm I'm putting all of my resources into something. So at this point, I start trying to document um I honestly, I just started writing and I um uh I'm not even sure I don't even remember what I wrote. I I don't remember. And then I'm like, okay, well, I need to get out of loud because of my visa issues. It's a risk, but I'm going to get on my flights to Thailand. But if I'm a risk, I know that sometimes airlines are used to make a death look like an accident. And if they know that I've got this illegal information and I want to kill this, then they might try and bring down the plane. So I'm worried about myself, but I'm also worried about the people on the plane. I don't want a plane coming down because I'm on it. So one of the other things that the oil rig person had said was once you do want to put your information out, that actually protects you because if you get killed or disappeared right after your information goes out, then um, then you're more like it kind of implies that your information was correct, because why would they want to kill you if the information's not correct? It's kind of like the same thing with the Facebook book, the woman that wrote the book, why would they want to suppress it? if it's not true? So if it's not true, who cares? She's making invalid points. If it's true, and they can't refute it, then I believe that her book is true. I haven't read it. I just assume that she's why would she make it up and you all of that that puts her at risk and it's not going to, I don't know, maybe she's trying to make money, who knows? So I'm concerned about passport control and I'm concerned about the people on the plane, but I say I'm going to go for it anyway. At this point, I'm staying in a hotel and I'm like taking the motorcycle to pick up my daughters and take them to school in from their mom's house every day because her mom and mom's a disaster and we can't get along. So I've got a lot of stresses. My ex-wife is suing me at the same time. These are the kind of things that bring out psychological episodes. So it just happens that I'm having a psychological episode at a time when I'm also going through this kind of or it's a combined stresses of calm and being a disaster mom for my kid, Susan divorcing me and whatever this illegal information issue, I believe that I'm an enemy of the state for having this illegal information and and I'm concerned that they're going to take me out for that purpose. And that's I have committed no crime. I believe in free speech. All I do is talk to people, analyze and and um try and put things together. So then I'm probably skipping some stuff, but I'm like, it's my last day ino and I'm driving to pick up the kids and I'm just I've been just flying on the motorbike. I don't like, calm always gets in the way of anything that I want to do and I've been trying to tell my story to write it down and I just can't. And that's why I ended up doing the podcast. I asked for support to do the podcast, but I did warn people like, I'm an enemy of the state. I don't want to put you at risk. Just just talking to me is a risk being in my circle is a risk. Like it's I don't I'm not a conspiracy theorist. I'm not I don't but I have seen a lot of things, obviously the movies and the movies are to some extent based on fact, like the Bourne movies or something like that. So I would say that my story is something like a combination of the matrix and and Bourne or something like that, but I literally am I'm taking my kids to school and there's this cement mixer behind me and he's going way fast. And I I'm like, I'm literally worried about getting killed. I People don't understand how things operate in like Southeast Asia and Africa. These are sketchy places sometimes. So I go to the house and say goodbye to my kids and ask ask Tom to take him to school because I don't want them to get run over by a cement mixer. I'm not making I know that sounds paranoid, but the um there's there are these potentials. They they want to make they look like an accident. um by this time I had released the information, which is why they would but I had done the the LinkedIn Post asking for people to assist with the blogging and then I nobody offered to assist, so I did some audio. I don't really know what's going on. I don't know. You can go back and look at those audios at this point. So then I get to the airport. Well, okay, so I dropped got through done with the kids, went back to the hotel, collecting my stuff and um com took me to the airport and I get to check in and that no no problems. Nothing unusual in Lau, just a standard delayed flight. The delayed flight can be an indicator that something's going wrong. Like any change, any glitch is potentially an indicator that something's going wrong. And I'm not saying there's always an indicator when something's going wrong, but there there often is. And I meet this uh Icelandic guy and we start talking and I kind of start telling him my story, and he has no doubt that I'm on a kill list. The rest of the world knows more about how the US opera than Americans do. So and I don't even know whose kill list I would be on. I I'm just specul a lot of speculation. I admit that. And some degree of paranoia, some degree of I don't know, what you want to call it skepticism. how do you combine all these things? How do you have paranoia and skepticism in this situation? So this is what causes cognitive dissonance, where it's a form of cognitive dissonance or I'm not a psychologist, I don't have a degree, but I it causes challenges in critical thinking when you have conflicting perspectives. And so there's a great Fitzgerald court, quote, something like the a sign of first rate intelligence is the ability to maintain multiple perspectives and still operate. And that's not a word for word, but you can look up something like that. And I do have high intellect. I always thought that my intellect was average, but the further I go through life, the more I realize that there's something different about me, that and I don't mean that to sound arrogant, but I just get so frustrated because I have so much information and I apply the rules of logic and critical thinking to the information that I get. I suspect everything I'm very skeptical. I I just go through a analytical process that other people don't seem to have. And it's super frustrating because so many people are standing in my way in this process that my family, my friends, everybody is like, no, you're crazy, there's nothing everybody that I don't know every stranger is like, yeah, that sounds true. So I'm not getting the support I need for my family. Sorry, guys. And I know I look crazy to them because they don't they don't how do I that what I just said, I hadn't told them um because I'm not a storyteller. You can tell by the way I'm telling this that I am not a storyteller. I also don't do audio and trying to type all this up. I just don't have time for it. I don't and I don't want to do it. I want to get on that plane and go, but I so I I did my best to protect myself and the people on the plane by releasing what I did in public. I know it looks crazy, especially if you look at my linkedIn history, it's like, here's this crazy troll, you know, heckling people and posting YouTube clips of music and like making jokes and just putting out random stupid stuff. But that was it ended up being part of the strategy to help me understand what's going on with these systems. And one of the other things is I would connect with anybody, so a lot of like we call them bots, but they're not bots. They're people managing accounts, but they're using LLMs and stuff so that they can translate their Russian to English without looking like a bot, without uh anyway, without looking like a Russian. So, you know, I'm kind of suspecting Russia because something is manipulating LinkedIn to to some purpose. It appears that something is manipulating linked into some purpose. And at this point, there's the whole Agent Krasnov story, a lot of the narratives that we receive in the United States is misinformation to distract us from what's really happening. So what's really happening is the war in Palestine, right? And Americans are being distracted by into other stuff. And everybody's like, just don't read the news. You know, the world would be better if you don't read the news. I'm not like that. I'm more of an activist. I can't stop reading the news, although I will I'm going on a retreat in Thai. And after that, I think I'm going to just I won't be on the Internet that week. We'll see how healthy that is for me. I'm definitely never getting on social media again. I'm writing a book against social media. I kind of lost my train I thought there. So I meet the Icelandic guy. We have a couple of beers. We I tell him the story. He totally thinks I'm rational. My family thinks I'm completely irrational. Probably everybody that reads my LinkedIn stuff thinks I'm like I've lost my mind and got it I went into one other book I did the vipolar incident with stack overflow on LinkedIn. I don't know why people still followed me afterwards because I probably look crazy after that that. Again, the stuff if I haven't looked back at that post, but if I do, I bet that what I said there is pretty accurate. It's just my reaction to it is like, wow, he's really upset and acting kind of weird as a result of this. Um, and again, there were other stresses in my life at that time. So, um, I'm going to pause again. Well, there's no pause, but I got to enter my pin, and pause. Okay, so at this point, I still think that the US government is the opposing force. um I'm just making sure that it didn't delete my whole thing. I think I'm at 30 minutes. I don't have to start this over again. um Something within the U. government is the opposing force and I'm starting to think that it's something above the US government because because the that contracting situation is not military. that that guy that flies, he's not military. is he a d is he a subcontractor of the military? Like a oh, what are those things called? not I don't know, they' the conscript things. They're they're more used in Russia. I'm sorry, I'm not dropping a word here. So I get on the flight. It's about an hour delayed, so I'm a little bit concerned about that. And the Icelandic guy had told me that now you need to fill out an electronic visa form for Thai three days before you enter. I have like a 20-year visa for Thai that has expired, and so I'm not really sure of my visa status. I'm suddenly concerned I might not have a visa for Thai. And then that's going to complicate things when I land because I've got to get through immigration without a visa. I don't know what's going to happen. And it's not really a a visa. It's a declaration of some, you know, it's a tracking. They want your it's a tracking system. They want your email address, they want your cell phone number, they want your a photo for facial recognition. They you know, so a lot of the world seems to be heading and Ty didn't use to do this. A long time ago, Ty had visa requirements, but it was such a hassle. They dropped it. and while I'm so I I land in DMK and I I'm in a rush, right? I've got a a short connection, even if it was on time. And now I've got this visa issue and, you know, when you go through foreign airports, the signs are in a foreign language and they rotate into English and it's really hard to find flight information in a hurry. and I don't know what gate I'm supposed to be at. So I initially I try to go through I, man, they have a sign that says transfers. So you you're in a rush and you see the sign that says transfers and you follow it, so I'm transferring from and and I get I go through I get up to the passport person and they're like, no, this is for for international transfers. So they didn't write international transfers. They just wrote transfers. They' like, you need to go to domestic transfers. So I go to domestic transfers and they're like, you need to fill out this form. And I'm like, the Internet says that the forms are not due until June. Like you're not starting this program until June and they make it clear. They're not going to let me through unless I do this. So then they start trying to do it on my phone. I'm really stressed at this point. but the woman can't figure it out on my phone. Like they can't figure it out. So then they make me go back to a kiosk and there's like at this point, I'm fuming. Like this is so wrong to to do this in 2025 to put people through this kind of crap just so you can track us, you know, just so I'm I'm really frustrated. And I go back and do do the kiosk thing and then I'm running through the airport. DMK is actually pretty big. People think that the BKK is big, but DMK is also pretty big. So I'm running from like 50 running from like 51 to I can't remember, but basically like ten minutes of running with a 20 pound bag and I'm a fat guy and some like in thongs, up escalators and just like crazy. hi, what are you doing? um and I get to the gate and my flight's delayed. This is so typical. They like you're in a r they put you through this incredible stress and then they screw up. I'm more stressed because they, my inbound flight was delayed and their stupid visa requirements. I got to be careful what I say about Tai, sorry. I love Thailand.s but this particular program is um a problem for me. And it was a problem for another guy that was there too. and also just the fact that you can't get you can't get support and information. People don't speak English and they don't really know how things work or where things are. It's really challenging. So I get to the gate and there's the Icelandic guy and we sit down and continue our conversation a little bit, and then I get on the he's so he's anyway, I get on the plane. At this point, I'm not worried because I'm I'm through passport control and I so I'm I'm in Thailand and I'm not I'm I'm no longer concerned that I'm going to have a problem with passport control. I still have some minor concern about the second flight, but I get on the second flight and get to Chang Maian okay. So this was another kind of scary thing. You have to understand. I I'm not paranoid, but the more like scary things that happen, the more I'm like, something weird's going on. So I get to um to to Chain Mai and there are no bags on the carousel and I got I've got his bag. They charged me a hundred bucks to carry my bag on this plane in a tiny bag. So I'm like, I have to ask somebody where the bag is. And, you know, when you I don't have a SIM card, so I can't contact my contact, um I think that they do have Wi-Fi there. So I was able to contact my contact. She's probably late. She's always late. The person that's picking me up. And um, so my my bag's not there, so I tell her I gotta go deal with my bag. And I talked to somebody and they're like, let me get somebody else and let me get somebody else, let me get somebody else. And eventually they determined that my bag is at international arrivals, because it came from VNTN and I didn't do the pass through thing in DMK. It's not there. I know this is not relevant to my story, but it kind of gives you an idea of like why I'm more stressed out than I need to be. So then they like start marching me through the not that's not the right term. They take me through from from domestic baggage claim to international baggage claim. This is a process I've never been through before. And there's like, they put a sticker on my shoulder and there's a person at each corner pointing me and I don't know if I'm being sent to some weird because I'm the only person going through this process. I don't know what happened to the other bags off that flight. Maybe since it was a domestic flight, everything was carry on, but I saw a couple of people collect bags, but usually baggage claim takes a while and um so I'm I'm a little bit nervous that I'm being sent to some, you know, immigration thing, but they really do. I just collect my bag and get out and and my contacts is there and everything's fine. I'm a little bit scared to show my passport when I check into a hotel, but I do it anyway. I mean, and at this point, I think that the forces that I'm dealing with are really significant, like government or above government. So I'm and those are powerful forces. So then I check into the hotel. Everything's fine. I'm a little bit concerned about the security at the hotel. but I can't do much about it. I got to sleep somewhere. um um so then, uh a couple of days late, maybe even just the next day, maybe this was just today or I'm not, I don't know. I don't sleep much and I'm trying to write a book about my experience or I'm trying to write a book about the lessons learned or the dangers of social media of as a result of like eight months of research trolling LinkedIn. And I'm getting a massage and I literally can't I have this like epiphany and I this happens to me sometimes. Your brain is working stuff out in the background and in this case, I've got a really complex phenomenon going on. I've got all this data about, you know, what's going on in LinkedI, what's going on in the world and then trying to assemble it. And I eventually come to the conclusion that LinkedIn itself is being manipulated by Israelis. And I don't know what those Israelis are because it could be and I don't I mean specifically Zionist Israelis. And so it could be that LinkedIn itself is, I mean, you might call it a honey pot of sorts, but it's it's a scam site in a sense. Like, you think you're there for business networking, but you're actually there to be manipulated by social media and tract. And this there's a lot of examples of this. like they keep pushing the mobile app no matter what you do. So they want you to install that app. It's a tracking app, for sure. There's no other reason they would want to do that. So and they don't improve the mobile site and that's to push the tracking app. So I have a lot more information about this, but I just don't have time or memory to deal with it. So is LinkedIn controlled by Zionists? Is it controlled by the United States government? Is are there some hack Zionist hackers inside it? If you again, going back to the trolling thing, they always play both sides, because if they only play one side, it's obvious what they are. So, you know, you're allowed to follow Algeazeera and algaaze has all sorts of anti-Irael content. It's not anti- Israel content, but it's kind of it's just exposing what Israel is doing. in Palestine specifically. And um I'll pause again. So, you know, I believe that LinkedIn is being used by Zionists, whether intentionally at a at a like organizational level, individually at a there's definitely some inside LinkedIn. I mean, I've seen evidence that of information suppression from inside. It's impossible to capture screenshots and prove everything. It's just over when you're trolling 24 hours a day, the um it's just impossible to to keep up. and even if I had all the video, I don't have time to parse it and I'm not a video person. So, um but I come to this con I just finally come to this conclusion that it's it's Zionists and this, although Israelis have they're known for having the best security penetration technologies being able to hack phones and stuff like that. So they are a powerful organization, but they probably are not looking at me as a threat. So if I was on a US government kill list, that would that would be a pretty significant threat. If if Zionists don't like my content on LinkedIn, I don't think that's a very big threat. But I think they made a mistake. I think that they should have banned me like outright because they should have seen this threat coming. The I think they were worried about the class action lawsuit and being exposed in that way, like, as a financial risk or a reputational risk. And so they let me stay regardless of the fact that they really should have let me go really, really should have banned me a long time ago. God, I was trying really hard to get banned. And they would be supportive. I would tag linked in at my posts and they would say like, well, can we assist you? One of the things that happened in that process was that they they acted like they did not have access to my direct messages. This is a real concern about LinkedIn. You're using this site for business networking and they have access to your direct messages. And I believe that there are insiders inside LinkedIn that are corrupt or that LinkedIn itself is corrupt. If you think about how that could influence business, you can see there's a risk. It's the same thing as like Facebook, Facebook's, you know, insiders were able to stalk their their ex-girlfriends and stuff like that from within Facebook. Well, on a business network, you can get insider information and like that's kind of a scary concept in itself. So I believe that this requires an investigation, an investigation of the LinkedIn Corporation, and I believe there will be evidence inside. I don't believe this investigation will occur because I actually believe that Zionism is currently running the United States. I believe that Zionism and greed have corrupted Christianity in the United States resulting in things like MAGA and that they're using social media to manipulate those people to be supportive of America or to not pay attention to what America's doing. Because mean let's let's call America and Zionism one thing. Just just I'm speculating, right? I'm not saying that this is a fact, but it it would explain a lot of stuff. if you if you kind of look at it that way, like let's say that Zionism is really what's running America, so running the U. government got Trump elected, you know, and then Trump has in service of Zionism has to do these things. I believe that Trump's tariff policies are really to apply leverage over other countries. They cannot possibly be financial policies. They're disastrous financial policies for United States and its status in the world. The United States is really going downhill fast from a variety of perspectives and the world's becoming a police state in some places. Well, I'm going to take another pause and see if I have any really important points to make. One second. I'm not good with phones at all, which is why I wanted somebody else to do this. I can't even get my phone unlocked. So, because of my political statements that I've expressed online, I still fear at least immigration to the United States and any border crossing with a country that is complicit to the tariff policies, because I think that those policies are actually being used to enforce the police state rather than financial policies. I also think that there's a tangent on artificial intelligence here. So, like I had said, or maybe I didn't say this before the admit the election, or, um, everybody was talking about artificial intelligence, and there was a lot of pro-AI and a lot of anti-A content. So there were a lot of skeptics saying this is never going to work and it's going to take a lot of resources and fail, and it's going to be a disadvantage to the underprivileged. And there was also all the hype the AI hypers. And in my recent experience, there's been much less AI hype and much less anti-AI hype because the anti-AI hype is mostly countering the AII hype and the AI hype itself has reduced it. I'm not really sure why we seem to be approaching the next AI winter. um which means that AI we realize that AI is not gonna pay off and AI will pay off in certain domains, like, you know, medical research or whatever. But in the way that people expect with agents and um LLMs are obviously they've got all sorts of unfixable problems, I don't think that stuff's gonna work. So I'm trying to figure out the people that run everything are not stupid. They they do things for a reason and they don't make stupid financial decisions. They do sometimes they're bubbles and they're like the metavers or NFTs. There are there are exceptions, but AI looks like a really dumb investment to me because I don't think it's going to pay off, and it certainly doesn't take the scale of processing that they're talking about $100 billion dollar server farms and stuff to to to do AI. I mean, deep seek proved that for sure. So what is gonna happen to this infrastructure this that's being built for AI when this AI winter comes and do the people that are investing in this infrastructure already know about that? So when LLM's you know, it's happening already, we know, it's not gonna work. we've actually known the whole time that LLM wasn't gonna work. So the whole story is if we scale it, it'll work. It's like stupid. doesn't that that's scientifically impossible. So um but they kept going with it. So I believe that that these data centers are actually going to be used for surveillance and for possibly Bitcoin generation, but they're using basically graphics cards, which if it was for Bitcoin, you would use AsI. So I would I don't know why I'm trying to figure out why they're making this investment and the only possible solution I can come to is that it's for surveillance and manipulation. Like the whole AI industry is about surveillance and manipulation. And in fact, most of it has been the whole time. What you know, the digital experience manipulation and and manipulating votes, that those that's we we call that AI. ML. ML is machine learning, it's about it's the AI branch, our category, so so I I just feel like it all makes sense if we look at it from Zionus control United States, Trump is a puppet, he's a distraction, so that we don't pay attention to what's actually happening, which is the encroachment of the police state and the movement towards an authoritarian regime in the United States. I honestly believe they're trying to establish a global world order, an authoritarian world order run, I don't know, run by Zionists. Is that possible? I don't I'm not like anti- Jew I'm I think Israel is for everyone. I had a Jewish stepmother. I have I have respect for Judaism. It's a critical thinking religion. It's not a except as it is and don't think. So, but Zionism is kind of an exception, but it's it really seems like Zionism is running the the world at this point, the the or or at least the United States and Israel because, um and it really is the greater Israel problem, right? Or like Israel wants to protect itself from its region and expand. And so, um but that means it continues to bomb Islam, which continues to rile Islam and so there will always be this conflict, and I don't know I don't have a solution to this problem other than let's just stop the violence and open Israel to everybody. But then there will be retribution by those the fringe elements within the Islamic culture, like Hamas, whether Hamas is stirred up by Israel or a false flag or whatever it is, we see that this conflict seems to go on forever and I don't have the solution for it. I'll pause there. I mean, another perspective of if the if we have a defense industry in the United States, how does that industry make money if we don't use the weaponry? And I kind of figured this out or I came to this perspective based on the bombing campaigns in Laos in the American conflict in Southeast Asia. So the United States left 90 million pieces of unexploded ordinance behind after doing ten years approximately one sortie every ten minutes in Laos. That's a lot of unexploded weapons. So they're either testing it or using it to make money or there's some reason for that. And one of my philosophical razors or whatever you want to call it, is always follow the money. So everything in the world from my perspective happens for money and Zionists or Judaism controls a lot of money in the United States. and probably because of these tracking technologies in Israelis having the highest quality tracking technologies and penetration technologies, they probably have dirt on all these politicians and there's leverage being applied to like oh, so Ruby is a great example. Why would Rubio have joined the Trump thing? So maybe they had leverage over him? Is that possible? Because he wasn't as bad as he became, and then, you know, whatever campaign scandal, maybe they had that was they were using the ten million dollars that turned into eight.5 million. I don't have time to track all the stories. But maybe they were using information about his corruption as leverage over him or maybe he was corrupt from the beginning or something like that. But I just I don't have time or energy and and really I've lost interest. The American people don't care to stand up for their rights and for their constitution. and I don't I've never liked that country. I wanted to leave like before I met my ex-wife, we had agreed to leave. I stumbled into this situation. If you if you listen to my story, I did not intend to become a political refugee from the United States. I started trolling LinkedIn eight months ago and just stumbled into something that I didn't understand, and it's really big and it's really complicated. And I'm there's no certainty, there's no proof. All I have are theories, but um so I was having a a DM with a guy that was anti-AI and I think we were he became more anti-US He's a Canadian guy, and we were doing DMs on LinkedIn, and I know my DMs are watched, but I just don't care anymore. I mean, I'm already on the list, so what what does it matter really? um and all of a sudden our DMs disappear and that's a glitch, you know, that doesn't happen every day on LinkedIn. It hasn't happened ever for me. I have had DMs deleted, like or they they usually give you a warning. They say this DM may contain content that you don't want to see or something like that. This was weird and Iured I took a photo of the screen of my computer and and so all of a sudden the messages disappeared. I think I had been talking to him specifically about LinkedIn. And then I couldn't message him. He there was only one DM and his DM to me was so they are watching us and then I couldn't DM him I would get an error and then all the DM's came back and I wrote so they can be restored. It was just the strangest occurrence because the that like they might have realized, oh shoot, if we delete these guys' DMs while they're talking about LinkedIn being potentially corrupt, that is oh God keep forgetting this word, not real evidence, circumstantial evidence that that what they were talking about was correct. We also don't know at how are they monitoring us? We know that there's some AI or keyword filtering or something that's being used to do things autom automatically, because if you think about it, how do they monitor your DMs with a person without admitting that there's a person monitoring your DMs? So if if a DM gets blocked, they want you to believe that it's an algorithm blocking it, whether it's an algorithm or a person, right? We did not say exchange any swear words or anything like that. They were actively monitoring our conversation in this case and did something stupid and then tried to fix and then fixed it. Like, and we saw it. We bought but it's still it's not evidence. It's like that was weird that that that does not happen. And so I'd have to go back and find the threat. I don't know. This is what I'm saying. Any information can be manipulated. You don't know. I like this guy that I'm talking to, I don't know if he's a bot or not. I don't know if he's inside LinkedIn or not. that I can't I don't want to go into all the stories, but interacting with these people, I have literally seen accounts created back in 2007. that are apparently misinformation campaigns. So I believe that somebody, whether insiders or foreign agents, Israel, Russia, whatever it is, has been working towards a campaign to use linkedIn to influence politic politics, but potentially also to siphon business information, to influence election outcomes, et cetera. So I'm not making an accusation, a specific accusation. What I'm saying is this requires investigation, and in the political climate in the USA currently, that seems very unlikely to happen. And so I'm going to just end this there. That's like 55 minutes.</p>
