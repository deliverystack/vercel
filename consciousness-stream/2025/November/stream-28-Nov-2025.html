            <h1>JW Consciousness Stream - 28 November 2025</h1>
<p>This entry represents something like my stream of consciousness for Friday, 28 November, 2025. This is basically like a journal entry that I work on throughout the day and then don't go back to correct errors.</p>

<p>YouTube suggested this uplifting video that I found worthwhile:</p>

</ul>
<p>I can relate to much of what he said. Here are some quotes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;since the Second World War, this year, 2025, is the bloodiest year&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;more than 60 armed conflicts are going on all over the world in 36 plus countries&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The most disturbed territory is Africa and the biggest scene has been Russia, Ukraine and the genocide of Palestinian people in Gaza.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;world politics has failed us and the world's leaders have failed us.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;we have had all the gains that we could have had in the last 80 years and yet there is more desperation, more depression, more anxiety, more and more lifestyle diseases and more and more mental diseases&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The modern work, it isolates us. It isolates us from our communities, from our land, from our people, from our families.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;in a system which only worships profit and greed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;they start to get all kind of mental and physical diseases that are linked to isolation that are linked to loneliness that are linked to not living a natural life.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;they just go on living their miserable personal lives.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No matter how much you try to wake them up, they will still think that a BMW will make them happy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You know panic attacks will happen a lot of pressure will come a lot of anxiety even even depression.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The whole 21st century is purely narcissistic, only thinking about themselves&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You burn with the fire of your desires.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;come to come to non-western cultures go to non-western countries and see that the lack of material resources does not really mean that your happiness will be diminished. You'll find a lot of happy communities, happy people, even if they have not much in terms of material possessions. That's not the necessary condition to be happy in life&quot;</p>
<p>why the hell are we giving away our lives like that?...How much do we want to produce, produce, produce? How much more efficient do we want to become?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;everything is just super expensive and everything is in the hands of the rich people...They just want to have more and more and more for themselves&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;this is Kaliuga. The Hindu scriptures have said most horrible cycle is kalyuga. The...era of kali, the dark energies. The the divide between rich and poor keeps on increasing. The morality is completely thrown away. Greed, violence, selfishness is at its peak. But with the advent of kalyuga, we also know that next will be saty yoga. The the era of truth, the era of honesty and integrity. So we need to choose to lead the way&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's all an illusion.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So in my in my definition, in my heart, being awakened is a responsibility. It's not a release. And it doesn't take away from it doesn't mean that you can close your eyes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;no lotus grows without mud.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One perspective this raises for me is that conflicts such as war can be catalysts for rapid social change, though humankind often subsequently seems to step backwards, maybe as racists, authoritarians, and narcissists regain control from the compassionate majority.</p>
<p>Recently, it has started to feel cold in Laos, which is very unusual for me. I know it's winter, but I also wonder if it could be related to the huge recent rainstorms in the region.</p>
<p>My foot is healing slowly. It's a bit tender, stiff, and numb in places, and also very swollen. I have a habit of overprotecting it, such as setting the other foot on each downhill stair first. I think it's at a point where I need to start using it more, as  to some extent I apparently need to relearn how to sense things with and use that foot. It generally makes a cracking sound with each step now. </p>
<p>It's already Friday here, but I'm getting Thanksgiving messages. Nobody in Laos seems to celebrate Thanksgiving. Today is Wendy's sixth birthday.</p>
<p>I think I woke up around 2:00 this morning. It's just after 6:00 and I published this:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>Some songs for Wendy:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/bHyUSNPtNJ8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Beach Boys: Wendy</a>: &quot;Wendy left me alone.&quot; To be honest, I've never really cared for the Beach Boys - seems repetitive and formulaic, but this one is entertaining to watch.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zjh80iwj8rg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pink Floyd: Another Brick in the Wall parts 1, 2, 3</a>: Since it's actually me a that leaves her alone, these lyrics always get me: Daddy's flown across the ocean,, Leaving just a memory, A snapshot in the family album, Daddy, what else did you leave for me?, Daddy, what'd you leave behind for me?&quot;</li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/KaQe09P5Qzo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">THE SOCKS SONG!</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/ekr2nIex040" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ROSÉ &amp; Bruno Mars: APT</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/eE9tV1WGTgE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lenka: Everything At Once</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/FLGCGc7sAUw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bella Poarch: Build a B*tch</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/ENXvZ9YRjbo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Weezer: Say It Ain't So</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHQqqM5sr7g" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Weezer - Undone -- The Sweater Song</a>: &quot;If you want to destroy my sweater (Woah, woah, woah, woah), Hold this thread as I walk away (As I walk away), Watch me unravel, I'll soon be naked, Lying on the floor, lying on the floor, I've come undone.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Today was International Day/Festival of Nations at Wendy's school here in Laos. Wendy is half Lao and half American (primarily of British heritage). In addition to their classes representing at least ten different nations (Wendy's class represented France), there are children at the school from many more, with no real separation between any of them. It was a great event full of respect, appreciation, and knowledge sharing. Unfortunately, I'm basically worthless with a camera, and of course my foot limited my mobility and kept me in fear of being stepped on by fast-moving children everywhere. Probably unrelated, there was a helicopter flyover during the event.</p>
