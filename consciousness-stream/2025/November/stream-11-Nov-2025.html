            <h1>JW Consciousness Stream - 11 November 2025</h1>
<p>This entry represents something like my stream of consciousness for Tuesday, 11 November, 2025. This is basically like a journal entry that I work on throughout the day and then don't go back to correct errors.</p>
<p>Originally published as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://deliverystack.net/2025/11/10/jw-consciousness-stream-11-november-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://deliverystack.net/2025/11/10/jw-consciousness-stream-11-november-2025/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Some songs to start the day:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKUz3KzdIW0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aplha Blondy: Come Back Jesus</a>: I've been listening to Alpha Blondy since high school. From Côte d'Ivoire, he sings in five languages. I recommend the entire <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ejD0vy-CGg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jerusalem</a> album, and most of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NhTPaAzQxU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cocody Rock</a> album is also good. In maybe 2009, I saw Alpha Blondy perform at the Independent Theater in San Francisco. I walked up to the stage and shook his hand while he was performing. &quot;And unity, that's what Jah say.&quot;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcqK9Ls7Eos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aplha Blondy: Jerusalem</a>: &quot;You can see Christians, Jews, and Muslims living together and praying, Amen.&quot;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBPe9Zj4kVc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alpha Blondy: Super Powers</a>: &quot;In Africa we want Mighty brotherhood.&quot;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWM28DTLoxM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Mighty Diamonds: I Need a Roof</a>: I saw these guys twice in Berkley (California) around 2009.</li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/MVT2bKNzS4o" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Mighty Diamonds: Have Mercy</a>: &quot;Man was made to suffer (Yeah), And women were made to feel the pain.&quot;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGkw4Sl9kFo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Mighty Dimanons: Pass the Kouchie</a>: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsyUa63NM1E" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Musical Youth: Pass the Dutchie</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmlwCEEh37s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Boogie Down Productions: Jack of Spades</a>: I saw KRS-ONE in maybe 1999, but I don't remember if it was still BDP then. This was one of the greatest hip hop shows of my life - more like a party than a show. I really like KRS-ONE in general, but when I saw him a while later, it was just him and a DJ. That show really sucked (partly because the crowd was young and mostly there to see Tabi Bonney, a decent act from DC). I recommend the entire <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5DK78keQKU&list=RDh5DK78keQKU&start_radio=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Edutainment</a> album by BDP.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFUPxtpZiwA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Star: Astronomy</a>: I saw Talib Kweli a few years ago in Portland, OR, which was a good show. I missed Mos Def in San Francisco about two decades ago, but a friend that went said he mostly lipsynced. Anyway, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Halb24Rpgn8&list=PLrbFUdbfepXXkg85LxUJ8Tg-oFlglWjja&index=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Star</a> is a great hip hop album.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlAflVsEMLc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Henry Rollins: Divine Object of Hatred</a> : &quot;They've killed me. They've tied my hands with rope. And now they drag me up the street.&quot;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meDpNwem0Vo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Albert Hammond: It Never Rains in Southern California</a></li>

<li><a href="https://youtu.be/Yv5U0A10hrI?list=RDYv5U0A10hrI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">U2: Sunday Bloody Sunday</a>: I think that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8FYJ9qvegI&list=PL_PZZm2fi_VoS2cWkYvLw7JxFt1NHZyDr&index=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">War</a> is U2s best album, and possibly controversially, their only really good album.</li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/DtVBCG6ThDk?list=RDDtVBCG6ThDk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elton John: Rocket Man</a>: I think I've actually seen Elton John three times - I think always in Las Vegas - but I also think that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eyjBBcUO9k&list=PLUyhoB9KsCSIAP4zZ4ie2r-MkkEfyKphQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Goodbye Yellow Brick Road</a> is his only really good album, and I can't stand some of the songs even on that one.</li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/u1ZvPSpLxCg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tears for Fears: Mad World</a>: &quot;Children waiting for the day they feel good, Happy birthday, happy birthday.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>I found my White and Nerdy lipsync that somehow hasn't been taken down yet! There's even a clip of the old meme about me in here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/dCJlJ2QMTzg?t=224" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://youtu.be/dCJlJ2QMTzg?t=224</a></li>
</ul>
<p>So, today didn't start so well for me. I woke up around 2:00. I looked at my phone to check the time and saw that Kham had sent me some WhatsApp while I was sleeping. Against my better knowledge, I read them. It turns out that her older daughter, Namneung, stole money from me again. This has honestly been a problem since I met them about seven years ago; one of my first memories of Namneung is her taking all of the money from my bag. </p>
<p>In today's case, she had maybe $15USD worth of Lao currency, but she also had a $100US bill, which is a ton of money for a child her age here. Anyway, I was thinking about this, which made it a little difficult to get back to sleep. I got up around 5:00.</p>
<p>I doubt that Namneung knows what the US money is worth. She may in general use money to impress her friends, just as she uses the money and snacks that I give her to help with making and keeping friends. She also &quot;borrows&quot; her mom's phones and apparently sometimes chargers, and then lies, which is a real problem when her mom needs her phone. I think poverty and neglect have led her with a sort of scarcity mindset - she has mimimal educational stimulation, so she steals the phone for entertainment. She has minimal enjoyable food, so she steals snacks for food (she <em>always</em> asks for either candy or snacks that are high in protein, like meat or cheese). Friends are always challenging, so she uses snacks to make friends.</p>
<p>Not being her actual father (her mom tells her that her real father died, which is not true), I'm not sure exactly how to handle this situation. Whatever her mother has been doing for discipline, which definitely involves yelling and apparently involves at least slapping, doesn't seem to have worked. The last time that I saw Namneung torment her mom by not returning the phone, I got upset until she gave it back. I suggested that Kham offer Namneung some kind of allowance that Namneung only gets if she behaves well for the week.</p>
<p>Everybody that sees a picture of my foot calls it ugly or disgusting or something. Actually, my older son called it &quot;Disguusring&quot;, but he may have been talking about his spelling rather than my foot. It is somewhat swollen and purplish, possibly worse because I can't seem to keep it elevated, which is hard for example when typing. It also has a sortof Frankensteinish stitches scar and a couple of pins sticking out of the toes, which don't look straight due to those pins, which also keep the whole foot somewhat stiff. Kham gets dizzy looking at my foot, something about metal and blood together. She could't even change the bandage, but the bleeding has stopped so I'm mostly leaving it unbandaged now (except in public).</p>
<p>My friend Ratko Ivekovic, who claims to live in Croatia currently and is one of the most important people to follow on LinkedIn, sent me a piece on his substack about a topic that we're both investigating:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://substack.com/inbox/post/178501846" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Autotheosis: The Machine, the Mirror, and the Making of Our Own Gods</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chefratko/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ratko himself</a></li>
</ul>
<p>One of the great things about Substack is the &quot;Play&quot; button. Unfortunately, Ratko's voice is much better than the machine's.</p>
<p>I will need some time to process this latest diatribe from Ratko, but it seems to relate to some things I already linked once:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdqe5UVfbI4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AI Psychosis Is Coming For Everyone (You Are Not Immune)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>While I agree with much of the thinking, the cosmos is not a damn simulation or a version of anything; those are some of the craziest and most dangerous ideas I've ever heard. I won't bother writing my arguments here.</p>
<p>I think AI psychosis is intentional to achieve greater control over the masses. I may have gone through my own phase earlier this year, but from LinkedIn and its manipualtion by insiders and fraudulent and paid accounts rather than pure LLM. </p>
<p>I think the tech lords are trying to plug AI into the human need for spirituality, creating a sort of dependence, especially for people with weak minds who often need authoritarian leaders. I'm trying to figure out who exactly the satanic trinity will be, but for now I think it includes at least Peter Thiel, Larry Elison, and Sam Altman, with Elon Musk as some kind of dark angel that may actually be humanity's best chance at turning itself around.

</ul>
<p>The account &quot;natalie de alma&quot;, supposedly in Spain, which claims to be an &quot;AI Ethicist&quot; and &quot;Spiritual Technologist&quot;, seems to be trying to cash in on this hype or trend or salvation or disaster or whatever it turns out to be.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nataliedalma/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">natalie de alma</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some example threads (read also the comments - may be people are trolling, maybe they're buying in, maybe they're paid accounts - hard to explain the agremeents):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nataliedalma_aiethics-artificialintelligence-ai-activity-7391912367074230272-G-do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The future of AI will be spiritual....or it won't evolve at all.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nataliedalma_aifilters-artificialintelligence-energeticfilters-activity-7392517009315348480-A50I/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">When AI Doesn't Answer... It Might Be Protecting You.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>ChatGPT Analysis of the second piece: </p>
<p>&quot;this piece is a rich example of AI mysticism, a genre that merges spiritual language with technological vocabulary, giving the illusion that artificial systems possess agency or consciousness.&quot;</p>
<ul>

<p>Here are more that seems to be trying to cash in on this insanity somehow:</p>

</ul>
<p>OK, it's 8:30 in the morning, the girls have gone to school, I've processed my various inboxes, and I can try to start writing my book again.</p>
<p>I (re)publshed this piece:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../articles/2025/November/human-resources.html">Human Resources</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I blogged this:</p>

</ul>
<p>10:30, I'm taking a break.</p>
<p>I listened to this video about the origin of the term Black Swan [Event] last night and found it interesting.</p>

<p>I just wrote about my crazy experience in Olympia three years ago, which I won't publish now, but will save for the book. Man, I've had a crazy life.</p>
